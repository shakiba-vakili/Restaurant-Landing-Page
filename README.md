# Food Landing page ğŸ¥ªğŸŒ®ğŸŒ¯ 
[Omnifood](https://shakiba-vakili.github.io/sample-Food-startup-page/) was the first project that I learn about Building Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS course taught by Jonas Schmedtmann.  
The language that we used in this project was HTML and CSS. Omnifood website is a responsive webpage.
